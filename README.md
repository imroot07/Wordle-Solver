# Wordle-Solver
A small project i'm working on that you can use to solve the puzzle game wordle.

### How to use:
- Step 1: Make a new wordle game and guess your first word.
- Step 2: Type the word on the first line of wordle.txt and then put a space and after that put a 0 for gray, 1 for green, and a 2 for yellow.
- Step 3: Run main.py and it will show a list of words and atteps to sort them by most common. Choose a word and type it in on wordle.
- Step 4: Type the word in on the next line of wordle.txt and put in the numbers.
- Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you guess the word.
