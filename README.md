# Wordle-Solver
A small project i'm working on that you can use to solve the puzzle game wordle.

### How to use:
- Step 1: Make a new wordle game and guess your first word.
- Step 2: Type the word on the first line of wordle.txt and then put a space and after that put a 0 for gray, 1 for green, and a 2 for yellow.
- Step 3: Run main.py and it will show a list of words and atteps to sort them by most common. Choose a word and type it in on wordle.
- Step 4: Type the word in on the next line of wordle.txt and put in the numbers.
- Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you guess the word.

### Javascript:
- If you want to be able to run this in the browser, there is an option.
- However, you have to use https://wordlegame.org or else the code won't work.
- To use it, create a new book mark and give it a name. (eg. wordlehack)
- Next, right click on the bookmark and click edit.
- Now copy the code from `bookmark.min.js` and type `javascript:` in the bookmark and then paste the code.
- It should look like this:

**Name:** `YourBookMarkNameHere`

**URL:** `javascript:PasteTheCodeHere`

- Now if you click on the bookmark it will give you all of the possible worlds left.
- For the unminified version of the code, open `wordle.js`.

### Links:
